Hurray! here's my new blog powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org) and [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Octopress is a static blog generator (based on [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)) and Github Pages hosts my blog directly from my Github repository. 

I've become currios of Octopress since first comments I read, that is super fast and is simple to use. More I was motivated to make a change because of the heavy old Wordpress which lately became too slow. Plus no server setup and there aren't any hosting fees, as it's on Github Pages.

Migration from Wordpress took a few hours. I've used an export Wordpress plugin which scans your blog and generates an archive with all your posts written with markdown. I've lost all my comments, but there weren't much, so is not a tragedy. Now I'm using [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) and seems promising.

In the end I'm really happy with the change, my blog became really fast and very cheap.
